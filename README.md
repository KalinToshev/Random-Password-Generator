# Random-Password-Generator
This is random password generator, written in Java.

We all know that when we forget our password on a site, app, etc. in most cases we use the forgotten password feature. We know how important it is these days to have a secure, hard-to-crack password. This program generates a password with random characters (which characters are upper and lower case letters, numbers and other characters). The user himself chooses the length of the password that he wants, and the program has a validation of the length of the password that the user has chosen, and based on it, the user receives information about how secure and easy to crack it is.

Information about the program:
